## About PHP

**PHP** (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language designed for web development. It enables you to create dynamic web pages, interact with databases, and handle user input efficiently.

## What is a Server-Side Scripting Language?

A server-side scripting language runs on the web server, not in the user's browser. This approach allows the server to process requests, manage data, and generate customized content before sending the final output to the client's browser.
